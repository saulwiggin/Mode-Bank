An Android application which fetches Chuck Norris Jokes from an API and displays a recycler view filtered for explicit content. This forms the basis of the technical test for the interview which involves fetching
the Chuck Norris API and filtering the results to remove explicit jokes and also duplicates. The data will be displayed in material design widget for optimal user experience and a button provided will allow skipping to the next random joke.
I have taken a Test Driven Development (TDD) approach which will mean writing the test scripts before writing the code itself. 
The latest version of Android has been stipulated therefore the min Sdk version will be set fairly high to API 29 or Q which will run on approximately 8.2% of devices. The code base will be written in Kotlin which is the latest language 
relased for Android and is a subset of Java which allows for heightened productivity and introduces features off functional programming.
